# convert("RGB"): PNG may have transparency (RGBA), but JPEG doesnâ€™t support it, Hence RGB.
# quality=100: Maximum quality for JPEG, increases file size.
# subsampling=0: Prevents chroma subsampling such as preserves color detail, increases size.
# optimize=True: Does Compress efficiently without losing quality.
